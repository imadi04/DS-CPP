/*
Whis and Beerus are playing a new game today . They form a tower of N coins and 
make a move in alternate turns . Beerus being the God plays first . In one move player 
can remove 1 or X or Y coins from the tower . The person to make the last move wins 
the Game . Can you find out who wins the game ?
Input Format :
Contains three value N,X,Y as mentioned in the problem statement
Output Format :
A string containing the name of the winner like “Whis” or “Beerus” (without quotes)
Constraints:
1<=N<=10^6
2<=X<=Y<=50
Sample Input :
 4 2 3
Sample Output :
 Whis

/*
Let us take few example values of n for x = 3, y = 4.
n = 0 A can not pick any coin so he losses
n = 1 A can pick 1 coin and win the game
n = 2 A can pick only 1 coin. Now B will pick 1 coin and win the game
n = 3 4 A will win the game by picking 3 or 4 coins
n = 5, 6 A will choose 3 or 4 coins. Now B will have to choose from 2 coins so A will win.

We can observe that A wins game for n coins only when it loses for coins n-1, n-x and n-y.
