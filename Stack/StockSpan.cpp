/*
The span si of a stockâ€™s price on a certain day i is the minimum number of 
consecutive days (up to the current day) the price of the stock has been less 
than its price on that ith day. If for a particular day, if no stock price is 
greater then just count the number of days till 0th day including current day.
For eg. if given price array is {3, 6, 8, 1, 2}, span for 4th day (which has price 2) 
is 2 because minimum count of consecutive days (including 4th day itself) from current 
day which has price less than 4th day is 2 (i.e. day 3 & 4). Similarly, span for 2nd 
day is 3 because no stock price in left is greater than 2nd day's price. So count is 
3 till 0th day.
Given an input array with all stock prices, you need to return the array 
with corresponding spans of each day.

Sample Input 1 :
8
60 70 80 100 90 75 80 120
Sample Output 1 :
1 2 3 4 1 1 2 8
Sample Input 2 :
 4
 1 1 1 1
Sample Output 2 :
1 1 1 1
